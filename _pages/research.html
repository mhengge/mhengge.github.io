<h4>Uncertainty as a Predictor of Economic Activity</h4>

<p>This paper investigates the ability of uncertainty to signal risks to growth. I show that there are pronounced nonlinearities between uncertainty and future economic activity. These nonlinearities imply that changes in uncertainty shift the predicted density of future GDP growth. Notably, periods of high uncertainty coincide with a leftward shift of the lower tail of the density and thus signal downside risk to economic activity. I also study the relative importance of uncertainty and financial conditions in predicting future growth. Combining predicted densities in an optimal way suggests that while both uncertainty and financial conditions contribute to maximizing out-of-sample performance, uncertainty carries a larger weight in the optimally combined density of GDP growth.

<h4>Fear Thy Neighbor: Spillovers from Economic Policy Uncertainty </h4>
<p>joint with Nina Biljanovska and Francesco Grigoli, IMF working paper WP/17/240 (submitted)</p>

<p>High levels of economic policy uncertainty in various parts of the world revamped the debate about its impact on economic activity. With increasingly stronger economic, financial, and political ties among countries, economic agents have more reasons to be vigilant of foreign economic policy. Employing heterogeneous panel structural VARs, we test for spillovers from economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on other countries’ economic activity. EPU reduces growth in real output, private consumption and private investment, with spillovers from abroad accounting for about two-thirds of the effect. Using local projections, we show that shocks originating in the US, Europe, and China  reduce economic activity in the rest of the world, with the effects being mostly felt in Europe and the Western Hemisphere.

<h4>Factor Models for Non-Stationary Series: Estimates of Monthly U.S. GDP</h4>
<p>joint with Seton Leonard, IHEID working paper HEIDWP0013-2017</p>
<p>This paper presents a novel dynamic factor model for non-stationary data. We begin by constructing a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium growth model and show that we can represent and estimate the model using a simple linear-Gaussian (Kalman) filter. Crucially, consistent estimation does not require differencing the data despite it being cointegrated of order 1. We then apply our approach to a mixed frequency model which we use to estimate monthly U.S. GDP from May 1969 to January 2016 using 171 series with an emphasis on housing related data. We suggest our estimates may, at a quarterly rate, in fact be more accurate than measurement error prone observations. Finally, we use our model to construct pseudo real-time GDP nowcasts over the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. This last exercise shows that a GDP index, as opposed to real time estimates of GDP itself, may be more helpful in highlighting changes in the state of the macroeconomy.
