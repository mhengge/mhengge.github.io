Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD Candidate at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID) in Geneva. My research interests lie in the fields of macroeconomics, applied econometrics, and international finance.
I am currently visiting the Center for International Development at Harvard University.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
I am on the job market in 2018/2019 and I will be available for interviews at the 2019 ASSA meeting in Atlanta and at the 2018 EEA meeting in Naples. I expect to complete my PhD in summer 2019.<br>
